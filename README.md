# SE-Assignment-6

# Assignment: Introduction to Python
<!--Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.-->

 Questions:

# 1. Python Basics:
 # - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its:

Readability: Clear and concise syntax that resembles natural language, making it easier to learn and write.
Versatility: Capable of tackling various tasks, from web development and data science to automation and system scripting.
Extensive Libraries: A vast ecosystem of pre-written code (libraries) for common functionalities, saving development time.
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems without code modifications.

Python is Popular because :

Beginner-friendly: Excellent language for beginners due to its simple syntax and emphasis on code clarity.
Efficient development: Streamlines development with libraries and a focus on readability.
Large community: Extensive online resources, tutorials, and support from a vast developer community.

Python is used in:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask power many web applications.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make Python a leader in these fields.
Automation: Python scripts can automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency.
System Administration: Scripting tools for managing servers and automating system configurations.
Scientific Computing: Libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib enable complex scientific calculations and visualizations.

# 2. Installing Python:
# - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Download the latest installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.

To verify installation:

Open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version. You should see the installed Python version.

Virtual Environments:
It is not a must to set up avirtual environment but this is how to do it:

Virtual environments create isolated Python environments with specific versions and libraries for different projects, preventing conflicts. Tools like <venv> or <virtualenv> can be used to create and manage them.


# 3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
# - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

Here's a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!":

Python
print("Hello, World!")

To explain this :
print(): Built-in function to display output on the console.
"Hello, World!": String literal enclosed in double quotes.
Indentation is not required in this case, but it becomes crucial for defining code blocks

# 4. Data Types and Variables:
# - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

int: Integers (whole numbers) like 10, -20.
float: Floating-point numbers (decimals) like 3.14, 1.0e-5.
str: Strings (text data) enclosed in single ('') or double quotes ("").
bool: Boolean values representing True or False.
list: Ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets [].
tuple: Immutable ordered collection of items enclosed in parentheses ().
dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}.
Script Example:

Python
# Integer
age = 30

# Float
pi = 3.14159

# String
name = "Alice"

# Boolean
is_active = True

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 42}

print("My age:", age)
print("Pi value:", pi)
print("Hello,", name)
print("Active:", is_active)
print("Fruits:", fruits)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
print("Person:", person)

# 5. Control Structures:
#   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional Statements (if-else):

Python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")



    Loops (for):

Python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# 6. Functions in Python:
# - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.


Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They promote modularity, code organization, and maintainability.

Python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers and returns the sum."""
  return x + y

# <!--Calling the function-->
result = add(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)


Explaining it:

def: Keyword to define a function.
add(x, y): Function name and parameters (placeholders for input values).
"""Adds two numbers and returns the sum.""": Docstring (optional) explaining the function's purpose.
return x + y: Statement that calculates the sum and returns it.
result = add(5, 3): Calling the function with arguments (actual values passed to the parameters).


# 7. Lists and Dictionaries:
 # - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of elements.

Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.

Python
<!--List-->
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

<!--Accessing elements by index (starts from 0)-->
first_number = numbers[0]  # first_number will be 1
print("First number:", first_number)

<!--Modifying elements--->
numbers[2] = 10  # Change the third element to 10
print("Updated list:", numbers)

<!--Dictionary-->
person = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "city": "New York"}

<!--> Accessing values by key-->
age = person["age"]  # age will be 35
print("Person's age:", age)

<!--Adding key-value pairs-->
person["occupation"] = "Software Engineer"
print("Updated dictionary:", person)


# 8. Exception Handling:
  # - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling allows you to gracefully deal with errors that may occur during program execution.

Python
try:
  <!--Code that might raise an exception-->
  number = int("hello")  # This line will cause a ValueError
except ValueError:
  print("Invalid input: Please enter a number.")
finally:
  <!--Code that always executes, regardless of exceptions-->
  print("This code always runs.")


# 9. Modules and Packages:
 #  - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

 Modules and packages are reusable units of Python code. Modules are individual Python files, while packages are collections of modules organized hierarchically.

Python
import math

<!--Use functions from the math module-->
result = math.sqrt(16)  # result will be 4.0
print("Square root:", result)

<!--Example with a package (assuming you have the 'requests' package installed)-->
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
print("Response status code:", response.status_code)

# 10. File I/O:
  #  - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from a File:

Python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
  content = file.read()
  print("File content:", content)


  Writing to a File:

Python
data = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
  file.writelines(data)
  print("Data written to file.")
